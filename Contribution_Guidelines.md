# Contribution Guidelines

If you would like to contribute, just send a Pull Request. Please:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one to prevent duplicates.
- Try to make your Pull Request descriptive.
- New categories are welcomed, if you have 2+ tools to submit to that category.
- End all descriptions with a full stop/period and remove trailing whitespace.
- Check spelling and grammar.

## Things to note

Widgets section is kept simple as I only want to highlight the must-know ones as there's so many of them but to get started with Flutter we only need the basics.

This Guide is aimed to collect awesome Flutter resources and hopefully become the go to Flutter guide.

## Link Format

- Please, use the following format for the links in Pull Requests: `[Tool](link) â€” description`. The description should start from the lower-case letter unless it's starting with the tool name.

Please, add the appropriate labels:

- <img src="https://github.com/oliver-gomes/flutter-guide/raw/master/images/svg/screen-player.svg?sanitize=true" height="20"/> for any resource that is full video course. Use the following snippet: `<img src="https://github.com/oliver-gomes/flutter-guide/raw/master/images/svg/screen-player.svg?sanitize=true" height="20"/>`
- <img src="https://github.com/oliver-gomes/flutter-guide/raw/master/images/svg/flutterio-icon.svg?sanitize=true" height="20"/> for any resource made by Google's Flutter Team. Use the following snippet: `<img src="https://github.com/oliver-gomes/flutter-guide/raw/master/images/svg/flutterio-icon.svg?sanitize=true" height="20"/>`

## Review Workflow

I will do our best to review your submission as soon as we can. Your contribution might be rejected if the resources didn't pass our curation. Of course, this is very subjective and if you think I am being unfair, do let me know.
